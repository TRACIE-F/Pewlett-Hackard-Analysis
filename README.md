### Summary ###

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72,458

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? nope

Pewlett Hackard has 300,024 employees. 
1,549 eligible mentors
72,458 positions to fill
24% of the workforce is nearing retirement with 2% of the retiring crew elibile for mentorship. Each mentor would need 46-47 mentees each, and that seems ridiculous. Pushing a retirement age worker seems like a poor business decision. Losing any of those workers early without the ability to impart some of their wisdom to the next generation of worker will only further the pressure on the company.

It would also appear this company hasn't hired anyone since 2002, which might be the bulk of their problem. There should be a flood of applicants.
