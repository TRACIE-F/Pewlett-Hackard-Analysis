# Pewlett Hackard Analysis #


## Overview ##

Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead to prepare for the vacancies left by the impending mass retirement of baby boomers, being referred to as the "silver tsunami." To prepare for this vacancy, they will look at potential mentors to rise up into newly vacated senior level positions.

## Results ##

To analyze the data, I began by sorting it into four new tables:
  * The first table found all current employees born between 1952 and 1955 - the employees most likely to retire soon.
    * ![Table 1](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201.1.png)
  * The second table filtered our soon-to-be-retiring employees by their job title to begin to get an idea of where the gaps would happen.
    *  ![Table 2](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201.2.png)
  * The next table took the list of retirement-age employees and counted the number of vacancies per job title, to assist in preparing for filling the right vacancies.
    * ![Table 3](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201.3.png)
  * The final table determined mentorship program eligibility, which is employees born in the year 1965. With many vacancies about to open up, a strong mentorship program will be integral to success.
    * ![Table 2.1](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%202.1.png)

With these tables, we can analyze the company's needs to replace employees nearing retirement and utilizing their knowledge and skills to help train in up and coming employees and determine any areas of concern or gaps.

Query results indicate that a massive number of employees are nearing retirement age, with Senior Staff and Senior Engineers about to have roughly 50,000 vacancies. Here's how the overall numbers breakdown:

 * Pewlett Hackard has **300,024** total employees. 
 * There are **72,458** staff members nearing retirement.
 * With narrow parameters, there are **1,549** eligible for the mentorship program

### Summary ###

As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, **72,458** roles need to be replaced, which is a significant portion of Pewlett Hackard's overall workforce. 24% of the workforce is nearing retirement with a small number of mentors available.

**Mentorship Insights**

Within the list of 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship, I wanted to know if the eligible mentors would properly reflect the group nearing their departure.

**Mentorship Title Counts**

It appears the mentorship-eligible crew titles match well with the retirement-eligible employees. There are a large number of senior staff and esnior engineers, with engineer, staff, technique leader, and assistant engineer. The only missing roles are assistant engineer and manager. There are only two managers retirement-eligible, but there are 1,090 assistant engineers who areretirement-eligible. 

With 72,58 vacancies and 1,549 eligible (not necessarily interested) mentors, each mentor would need 46-47 mentees each, and that seems ridiculous. Pushing a retirement age worker seems like a poor business decision. Losing any of those workers early without the ability to impart some of their wisdom to the next generation of worker will only further the pressure on the company. I would suggest expanding mentorship eligibility for any additional qualified and interested workers, especially those holding the title of senior staff, senior engineer, and assistant engineer.
