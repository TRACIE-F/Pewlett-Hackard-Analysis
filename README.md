# Pewlett Hackard Analysis #


## Overview ##

Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead to prepare for the vacancies left by the impending mass retirement of baby boomers. To prepare for this vacancy, they will look at potential mentors to rise up into newly vacated senior level positions.

## Results ##

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)



To analyze the data, I began by sorting it into four new tables:
  * The first table found all current employees born betweek 1952 and 1955 - the employees most likely to retire soon.
   * ![Table 1](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201.1.png)
  * The second table filtered our soon-to-be-retiring employees by their job title to begin to get an idea of where the gaps would happen.
   *  ![Table 2](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201.2.png)
  * The next table took the list of retirment-age employees and counted the number of vacancies per job title, to assist in preparing for filling the right vacancies.
   * ![Table 3](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201.3.png)
  * The final table determined mentorship eligibility. With a large number of vacancies about to open up, a strong mentorship program will be integral to success.
   * ![Table 2.1](https://github.com/TRACIE-F/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%202.1.png)

### Summary ###

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 72,458

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? nope

Pewlett Hackard has 300,024 employees. 
1,549 eligible mentors
72,458 positions to fill
24% of the workforce is nearing retirement with 2% of the retiring crew elibile for mentorship. Each mentor would need 46-47 mentees each, and that seems ridiculous. Pushing a retirement age worker seems like a poor business decision. Losing any of those workers early without the ability to impart some of their wisdom to the next generation of worker will only further the pressure on the company.

It would also appear this company hasn't hired anyone since 2002, which might be the bulk of their problem. There should be a flood of applicants.
